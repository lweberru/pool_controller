# Pool Controller - Advanced Home Assistant Integration

## Overview

**Pool Controller** is a Home Assistant custom integration designed to manage and automate your spa or pool when the device lacks built-in smart capabilities.

If your spa/pool is connected to a simple smart switch (on/off only), you lose access to important automation features (filtration cycles, temperature control, frost protection, water quality monitoring). **Pool Controller** brings these back and adds additional comfort/efficiency features.
